# MAS-Mecha-Anime-Simulator
Mecha Anime Simulator, of MAS for short, is an asymmetrical multiplayer game where the 6-12 players are split into two distinct teams in a setting not unlike a classic mecha anime which follows a monster-of-the-week format. While the protagonists tend to a majestic state-of-the-art battleship equipped with similarly fantastical mecha, the antagonists plot to destroy their ace in the hole with a whole arsenal of counterattacks. Will the antagonists wear down the heroes with waves of grunts led by one red-clad ace, or with a series of guerilla strikes with non-expendable prototype units? Will the heroes make it to their destination unharried, or will they be drawn into endless personal drama that puts their mission at risk? Can both sides stop their ace pilots from falling in love and getting the series cancelled? Find out in your semi-randomized session of MECHA ANIME SIMULATOR!
